# Credit Card Validator using Branchless

A C++ program that validates credit card numbers using Luhn's Algorithm, implemented using true branchless programming.

The rules for the program are:

- **No if statements** or ternary operators
- **No condition-based loops**, only `while (true)` allowed
- **No conditional jump instructions** allowed in the binary code

This repository is meant as a proof of concept and as a coding challenge.
It is not meant to be used in production.

Thanks to [Karan Pathania](https://github.com/karancodes) for the [original](original.cpp) C++ code.
